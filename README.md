# Financial Time Series Forecasting and Simulation

This project contains code for time series forecasting using LSTM and Prophet models, and for simulating trading strategies based on these forecasts.

## Structure

- `src/`: Contains the source code.
  - `models/`: Forecasting models (LSTM, Prophet).
  - `policies/`: Trading policies.
  - `simulator/`: The simulation engine.
- `reports/`: Contains generated reports, plots, and simulation results.
- `scripts/`: Contains scripts to run the simulations and generate reports.
